                        <p>Managing a restaurant blog is a big time commitment — it requires a creative mind, and it means you’ll have to constantly update your website. However, even if you’re only blogging once a month, that one post is building your brand and keeping your restaurant on guests’ minds. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Feature upcoming events on the blog, making viewers excited to join. Feature your employee of the month to show that you care about your team as much as you care about your customers. Talk about the restaurant experience — why lighting is so important, for example, or your opinion on restaurant tablets — to show that you’re a thought leader in the restaurant industry. Overall, it can be a place to continuously nurture interested customers, especially if you ask for their email address in a sidebar or header and email them posts whenever they’re published.
                        </p>
                       <p> The content on your restaurant website can help you reach, find, and secure new customers. What’s holding you back from publishing new content on your website? How is your website adding value to your restaurant?
